## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ The SED is involved in developing and testing different EEW algorithms in Switzerland and around the world. We focus on building operational software that allows us to account for complex EEW scenarios while at the same time making warnings faster and more accurate (see below). We also build tools for disseminating EEW to end users.
